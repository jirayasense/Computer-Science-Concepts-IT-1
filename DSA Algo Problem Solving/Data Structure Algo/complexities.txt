* Constant time Complexity 

2) Logarithmic Complexity : 
     - Growing very slowly

     Eg Divide & Conquer

3) Linear Growth

4) Pseudo Linear Growth :
    - n * lg(n)
    - Eg Merge Sort, Quick Sort

5) Quadratic Time :


6) Exponential Growth :
     - extremely dangerous

7) Factorial
    - faster than exponential

8) pow(n, n) 
    - worse of all

_________

* pow() & log() are used in correspondence to each other 
   \
    pow can be derived using log() in Logarithmic time
    pow & log are inverse of each other in the sense
