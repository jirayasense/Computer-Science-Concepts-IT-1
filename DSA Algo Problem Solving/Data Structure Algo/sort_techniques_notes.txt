Tips :
  
-> When array is sorted & you need to add new element into array at correct location
    1) Binary Search & Swap 
    2) Insertion Sort

-> In sorted array (1 -> n)
   property :- index = element-1


* Stable Sort (Order should be same when value is same)

* Bubble Sort : ()
  ----
   -> Also known as Sinking Sort | Exchange Sort
   -> Inplace
   -> Space - O(1)
   -> Largest element at the end at each step
   -> Counter + Pointer


* Selection Sort :
  ----
   -> Not Stable
   -> performs well for small lists


* Insertion Sort :
  ----
   -> Partially Sort 
   > Good if array is already sorted & to insert new item
   -> insert item to correct position in current array

   -> # swaps reduce compare to bubble sort 
   -> smaller values of n & when array is partially sorted 
   -> part of hybrid sorting algo


* Cyclic Sort :
  -----
   -> Sort in single pass (n comparision)

   => In sorted array index = element-1

   element from 1 -> n  or continuous numbers
