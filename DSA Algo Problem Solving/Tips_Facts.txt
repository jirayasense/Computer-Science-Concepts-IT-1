* Custom Data Structure & GC :
  -----------------
   -> When you implement a data structure of your own, then do remember to deallocate memory 
      (c/c++) to avoid memory leaks 

      Scenario :-
        Let say Stack, POP operation 
           -> the popped out object must be made null, so that it can be picked up by GC (java)
              asa no one is referencing it.


* Pre-Allocate Memory :
  ---------------
   -> If memory required is known earlier then don't do those at run time.
      As it may incur a optimization
