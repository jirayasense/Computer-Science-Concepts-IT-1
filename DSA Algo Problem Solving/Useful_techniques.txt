TIP -> Always first think for bruteforce approach

1) Binary Search

2) Kadane's Algorithm  (For max SubArray Sum)

3) 2 Pointers (Ramesh-Suresh)  (alike Quick Sort)

4) Fast & Pointer to find the middle index of List


=> When you need to find something potential ans in a range (i.e start & stop)
    - binary search can be useful
