TIP -> Always first think for bruteforce approach

1) Binary Search

2) Kadane's Algorithm  (For max SubArray Sum)

3) 2 Pointers (Ramesh-Suresh)  (alike Quick Sort)

4) Fast & Slow Pointer to find the middle index of List

5) Top Down Memomization

6) Bottom Up Memoization (DP)

7) sliding Window (esp for Anagrams)

8) Bucket Sort (for Counter Kinda Thing When size is bounded)
   Heap sort   (for quick add & delete)

9) slow & fast pointer (esp used with the linked list)

10) BFS & Queue (Iteration)
    DFS & Stack (Recursion)

11) Boyer-Moore algorithm (Majority Element)


=> When you need to find something potential ans in a range (i.e start & stop)
    - binary search can be useful
