* Upcast  (Implicit Casts)
  -----
   -> Implicit Widening 

      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20859702/dart-typecasting-error/20859856

   -> You can turnn off implicit-casts in dart by mentioning them in pubspec.yaml

   => TypeCastinng (Moulding or Upcasting) do not change the underlying types & do not create new instance
        \
         Instead it just restrict the field access on current object 


* generics & Constructor :
  -------------
   -> Constructor can't have generics types 

* Constructor Expressions :
  --------------
   factory constructor can be assigned using `=` during initialised i.e redirection


* Mixins Facts :
  ---------
   => Mixins can't have constructors
      
      But you can access Mixin in your class methods 

      Note -> if mixin have instance member then it can't be accessed inside static scope

* static members concept :
  ----------
   -> as we know static methods can access static fields 

      scenario 1) -> If static memebers is present in enclosing class 
                     -> then static methods of same class can access without full qualifier name

               2) -> If static members is from Inherited class 
                     -> then you need to use full qualifier name i.e (ClassName.memberName) in 
                        the Child's static methods.
   
* this & super, inheritance :
  ----------------
   -> Initializer List can be used for list for enclosing class only  
      \
       Why ? because `this` refer to enclosing class only so.

* Abstraction :
  ------
   (Ideas & Functionalities Only)

   - Declarative Way to Program

   - A way to deal with the ideas 
      (ie pondering the high level functionalities without knowing the Low-Level Impl)

   - In programming this is done by providing the interface ie APIs 

  WHY ABSTRACTION ?
    - for impl-agnostic
    -> When you want to Decouple the impl from the application i.e impl-agnostic 

    Decoupling such way is done for 
    
    - Long term maintainence
    - Easier to Understand  
    - Easier to test  (Mock Versions | Fake Data Versions)
    - Implementation can be Swapped out 
    - Speeds up the architecting the Development (Services & Functionailites)
    - fake Data is king & abstraction allow us to use Fake Data efficiently

    Eg You can start development even if API is not completed
