* generics & Constructor :
  -------------
   -> Constructor can't have generics types 

* Constructor Expressions :
  --------------
   factory constructor can be assigned using `=` during initialised i.e redirection


* Mixins Facts :
  ---------
   => Mixins can't have constructors
      
      But you can access Mixin in your class methods 

      Note -> if mixin have instance member then it can't be accessed inside static scope

* static members concept :
  ----------
   -> as we know static methods can access static fields 

      scenario 1) -> If static memebers is present in enclosing class 
                     -> then static methods of same class can access without full qualifier name

               2) -> If static members is from Inherited class 
                     -> then you need to use full qualifier name i.e (ClassName.memberName) in 
                        the Child's static methods.
   
* this & super, inheritance :
  ----------------
   -> Initializer List can be used for list for enclosing class only  
      \
       Why ? because `this` refer to enclosing class only so.
