* If you want to preserve the child under Expanded then use Align() in between i.Expanded 
   
   Expanded(child:
      Align(
          align: Alignment.BottomCenter,
          child: YourWidget()
      )
    )

* padding vs margin 
  ------------
   When there is no child for container at that time padding value is useless, so need to use margin at that time

* ViewPadding vs ViewInsets :
  ------------
   In Flutter, a Widget, usually a Scaffold , can consume viewPadding, padding or viewInsets 
   and modify the MediaQuery which then is passed down to itâ€™s child.

* barrel file = file of import statements
