* DI 
  Its very bad practice to create/instantiate object inside Activity
  because it makes object dependent on that activity 

  DI dont change functionality of app but makes more cleaner & better architecture wise


Kodein.lazy{} allows us to use application context`


Dagger vs Kode-in :
  -----
  Dagger - is a Dependecy Injection 
  Kode-in - service locator 

  DI :- happens at compile time 
  Service locator :- happens at run-time

  So Dagger is more performant thann Kode-in
