* Stack vs Heap ;
  -----
   in Python 
     to compare reference equality :- `is`
    & to compare value equality   :- `==`


* Tuple & Copy :
  ---------
   - When you create a tuple from another tuple then same tuple object is referred (ie Canonical Form)
   - There is no point in creating a Shallow Copy of an immutable obj so thus its just making a copy of reference
