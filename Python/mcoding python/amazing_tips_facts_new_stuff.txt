   -> to get actual representation of number in floating pt repr 

   Note :- floating point number are represented in this way for 64 bits number :-
          \
           -> (-1)^sign * 2^ (e-1023) * 1.fraction   // fraction bit comprises of 
            
                sign     exponent     fraction
                
                1 bit    11 bits      52 bits

           -> if repeated decimals the it will get rounded or truncated at some point
              that is why .1 + .2 is not .3 (ie rounding error)

   Struct.pack() rule :-
      When exponent gets down to 0 -> You drop 1 at the begining of fraction
       \
        this allows to few more power of 2 to closer to 0
